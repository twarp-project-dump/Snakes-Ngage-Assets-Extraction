# Snakes (NGage game) Assets Extraction Guide

What you'll need:
1. A ```.sis``` of Snakes below version 0.6.X.X (Explanation will follow, info on versions is fuzzy)
2. A working setup of [EKA2L1](https://github.com/EKA2L1/EKA2L1) (to extract the .PAK files)
3. [Offzip](http://aluigi.altervista.org/search.php?src=offzip) to unpack the .PAK files

How to extract raw asset files:
1. Install the ```.sis``` you have into EKA2L1.
2. Locate the .PAK files (Mine were located over at ```\[PATH TO YOUR EKA2L1 INSTALL\]\data\drives\e\System\Apps\6R45)
